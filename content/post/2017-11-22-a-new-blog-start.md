So, I'm starting a new blog. The five of you who following [my previous blog](amidatasci.wordpress.com) are probably wondering "wtf dude?! Why stop a good thing that you haven't posted at for almost a year?"

Two reasons.
1. All the cool data scientists are moving their blogs to hugo and I don't want to be left out
2. Via [blogdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/), I can connect the blog more directly to my code repositories, which make it easier to produce content and (hopefully) lets me get more stuff out!

I'm sitting on what I think are some cool projects that I hope to be able to share soon. Specifically, an app I built to predict a movie's revenue based on the plot summary, the actors, and the production companies. I'm also dabbling in using machine learning to predict NFL and NBA player performance and optimize lineups for Daily Fantasy. My plan (fingers crossed) is to get some of that content out over the next few weeks.

So here's to a fresh (blog) start, and please bear with my while I figure this whole website thing out.
