Hi, I'm Aaron, and I'm a data scientist and currently a free agent

I live in San Diego with my wife, two sons, and dog.

My interests include R programming, golf, finance, fantasy sports, nba/nfl/pga, and way too much TV.

I also want to give a shout out for [Donate Life](https://www.donatelife.net/). My wife recieved a liver transplant in January of 2017, and it saved her life. Please register to be an organ donor.
