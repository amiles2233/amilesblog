Hi, I'm Aaron, and I'm a data scientist at a marketing agency called [The Shipyard](http://theshipyard.com)

Schooling-wise, I studied sociology for both my bachelors and masters degrees, focusing on education and quantitative methods. While my background may be considered non-traditional for a data scientist, being trained to do analysis with the question in mind as well as getting experience analyzing human behavior has been a huge asset so far.

I primarily use R in my work (yes, yes, I know I need to learn Python), but I also have experience with SQL, Hive, Tableau, SPSS, and Stata.

Currently, I live in Columbus, Ohio with my wife, two sons, and dog.

I also want to give a shout out for [Donate Life](https://www.donatelife.net/). My wife recieved a liver transplant in January of 2017, and it saved her life. Please register to be an organ donor.
