My name is Aaron Miles and I'm a Data Scientist at a digital marketing agency called [The Shipyard](http://theshipyard.com). 

I did both my undergraduate and graduatge studies in sociology, primarily focusing on education and quantitative methods. After finishing my master's I transition to a career in data science and haven't looked back. I primarily work in R and love using machine learning to answer weird questions, and that's what this blog is for!

I live in Columbus, Ohio with my wife, two sons, and dog.
